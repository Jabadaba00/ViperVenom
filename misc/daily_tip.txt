Did you know? ViperVenom was created by only one developer and was planned and developed for more than four months.
ViperVenom has only one payload named "merciless" would you like to see Linux payloads in the future?
ViperVenom is undetectable for the latest and best antiviruses out there, and ViperVenom is free to use!
Would you like to see ViperVenom Professional in the future? Let me know.
ViperVenom is as silent as the real Viper, it's undetectable, and its venom. Damn! Very deadly, just like the real one.
